"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . "" sales tax is a pass through  and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the  consumers , "" he added .  - - - - - - -  centre yet to receive proposal on enron  thursday jan 18 2001  centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from  maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron  promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about  the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre  buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading  corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said "" we have not received any  proposal . "" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114  crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for  november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .",0

 steve :  i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think  it ' ll work .  just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be  interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying  behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,  along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer  response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need  to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe  that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct  marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to  whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other  promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )  because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on  actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than  demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new  entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have  some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many  players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet  utility needs .  i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but  i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to  arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron  might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )  listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .  thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and  hearing how things are going for you .  regards ,  brad davids  303 - 410 - 5531  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com [ mailto : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com ]  sent : monday , april 10 , 2000 12 : 13 pm  to : brad . davids @ abacus - direct . com  subject : re : possible meeting ?

"Subject: status  stinson ,  as you requested , i spoke with brad mcsherry concerning the position , salary ,  and immediate supervisor . i asked brad to provide a formal letter of offer  and informed him that i needed it before the end of business friday .  unfortunately , i have not received the letter thus far . although the job was  well defined , i felt that the administrative details of the position were not  clearly laid out . for example , i specifically asked last week who my manager  would be and was told that it would be you . however , i later found out ( by  chance ) that this was not the case . also , it was unclear whether i would be  in the research group or in enron communications .  although these two issues are not critical and under normal circumstances  would be resolved , given previous confusion regarding my role and  compensation with the research group , i feel less comfortable accepting the  position . to be specific , there was an unnecessary struggle regarding my  interview reimbursement and there were problems regarding my bonus . in  general i feel that there has been a significant lack of communication and  respect .  therefore i feel that i am left with the decision not to make the move to  enron and feel that it would be in everyone ' s best interest not to pursue  this any further . thank you .  - samer  [ brad , as i indicated on friday please do not perform any kind of transfer .  thanks . ]",0
