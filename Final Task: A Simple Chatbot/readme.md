## Video Game Dataset Chatbot using Python

### A Chatbot is a AI powered application that is used to mimic human like response. It is currently used by my Travel Companies so that less man power and more efficient work can be achieved.

#### For the dataset, we wil be using the wikipedia article about <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">Video Game</a>. This can be accessed using videogame.txt file.

### Required Libraries for running the Chatbot
1. <a href = "https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit)</a> ``` pip install nltk ```
2. <a href = "https://scikit-learn.org/">Scikit-Learn</a> ``` pip install sklearn ```
